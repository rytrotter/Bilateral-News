# Bilateral-News
A desktop app that displays two columns of news - One for bad and one for good


We're used to seeing news that's mostly negative. So with this project I wanted to separate between the good news and bad news. I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to break myself into using WPF rather than using WinForms.

### This project pulls JSON data from Reddit 
- **Bad News Data** - Pulls json data from [/r/News](https://www.reddit.com/r/News) sorted by controversial
- **Good News Data** - Pulls json data from [/r/UpliftingNews](https://reddit.com/UpliftingNews)

With this project I also wanted to put a bit more emphasis on the tools of desktop applications, such as a checkbox to trigger different events.
